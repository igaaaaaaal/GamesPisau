# Knife Games 2D

Hi, I'm new to making 2D knife games, using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

I also added the Java language to this game and you need to know that this game is webview based

If the game application doesn't run smoothly, it's a sign that you need "lib"

In the games file. You can download "lib" on our website
